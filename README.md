# Pxls

Pxls is a collaborative image editor where you can place up to six pixels at a time, inspired by Reddit's [r/Place][place] experiment.

**Note:** A Docker image is available at [aneurinprice/docker-pxls.space][docker] and on [Docker Hub][dockerhub].

## Prerequisites

- [Maven][maven]
- [Java 8][java]
- [JDK (for development)][jdk8]
- [Postgres][postgres]

## Building

1. Install the above requirements either via package manager (recommended) or by building from their sources.
2. Clone the repo:

    > $ git clone git@github.com:pxlsspace/Pxls.git

3. Navigate to the directory:

    > $ cd Pxls

4. Clean the package:

    > $ mvn clean package

The output `.jar` is in `target/`.

## Running

1. Create a new directory.
2. Copy `resources/` and the output `.jar` to it.
3. Copy `resources/reference.conf` to the directory as `pxls.conf`.
4. Configure `pxls.conf`.
5. Execute the jar with `java -jar pxls-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
  
The server will start on port 4567 by default, and will expose a rudimentary console with a few commands (listed in `Commands` below).
You will need to configure the database for the server to start, see the `Configuring Database` section below.

The config file uses [HOCON][hocon]. The config will not be automatically created, you must create/copy it yourself. Any unspecified option will use the default value from `resources/reference.conf`.

Pxls will automatically save a backup of the map every five minutes to `$STORAGE/backups/board.<timestamp>.dat`,
as well as before executing a blank operation and right before exiting (via Ctrl-C).

## Configuring Database

You will need to set the database URI/credentials in `pxls.conf`.

The relevant config options are `database.url`, `database.user`, and `database.pass`. An example database section in the config could look like this:

    database {
      url: "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:3306/pxls"
      user: "AzureDiamond"
      pass: "hunter2"
    }

## Configuring OAuth

OAuth keys must be set in the config file (see above). Right now, five services are supported - [Reddit][redditapps], [Google][googleconsole], [Discord][discordapps], [VK][vkapps], and [Tumblr][tumblrapps].

The config node `oauth.callbackBase` must be set to your app's URL (including protocol and port), followed by `/auth` (for example, `http://pxls.space/auth`).
On the OAuth setup page for the various services, you need to set the redirect URL to `oauth.callbackBase` followed by the service name. Reddit, for example, would be `http://pxls.space/auth/reddit`, and likewise for Google.

An example OAuth section could look like this:

    oauth {
        callbackBase: "http://example.com/auth"
        reddit {
            key: "AsPxXweEomQjUD"
            secret: "tYJlz_xbH-qjxw8xvKVj0qLXRCw"
        }
        google {
            key: "pxls-"
            secret: "AIzaSzAS9wxgdXw6G3Q2lGMlyxG03F3hmXEMnce"
        }
        discord {
            key: "112233445566778899"
            secret: "yo4DkHFDy0k1euPyxMef6m243qRgX00z"
        }
    }

## Configuring host
You must update the `host` option in your `pxls.conf` otherwise session cookies will not set, making auth impossible. `host` should be your domain (or IP if testing locally) without port.
    
## Configuring CAPTCHA

By default, CAPTCHAs are disabled, and need to be configured in the config to work.
You will need a [CAPTCHA key and secret][captcha]. The type must be `Invisible reCAPTCHA`.

The `captcha.host` key needs to be one of the approved domains on the reCAPTCHA admin panel. For local testing, this will likely be `localhost` (no port).

An example CAPTCHA section could look like this:

    captcha {
        key: "6LcedG4UAAAAAKA6l9BbRPvZ2vt3lTrCQwz8rfPe"
        secret: "6LcedG4UAAAAAIXZcNFhnLKvTQwG1E8BzQQt_-MR"
        host: "example.com"
    }


## Commands

Commands are entered directly into the running instance (stdin):

- `reload` - Reloads the main configuration, applying _most_ changes immediately.
- `save` - Saves the map.
- `role <user> <role>` - Changes the role of the user. The role can be either `USER`, `TRIALMOD`, `MODERATOR`, `DEVELOPER`, or `ADMIN`.
- `alert <text>` - Sends an popup-like alert to all users on the canvas.
- `ban <user> <reason>` - Bans the user for 24 hours, with the specified reason (if any).
- `permaban <user> <reason>` - Permanently bans the user, with the specified reason (if any).
- `shadowban <user> <reason>` - Shadowbans the user (hiding newly-placed pixels to all but themself), with the specified reason (if any).
- `unban <user>` - Unbans the user.
- `nuke <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2> <color>` - Replaces all pixels from (`x1`, `y1`) to (`x2`, `y2`) with the color (by index).
- `replace <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2> <from> <to>` - Replaces all pixels in the rectangle delimited by (`x1`, `y1`) to (`x2`, `y2`) from the color `from` to the color `to`
- `cons [authed]` - Lists the total (or authed) connection count.
- `users` - Lists all of the authed users, by username.
- `stack <user> [set <amount>]` - Sets the user's stack count. The user must not be on cooldown before setting.
- `cd-override list|<user> [on|off]` - Sets or lists the cooldown override status of an user
- `broadcast <message>` - Sends a message in chat
- `chatban <user> <length> <purge> <reason>` - Chat bans the user for `length` in seconds, optionally purges all of their messages
- `permachatban <user> <purge> <reason>` - Perma chat bans the user, optionally purges all of their messages
- `unchatban <user>` - Unchatbans the user
- `chatpurge <user> [amount] [reason]` - Purges up to `amount` chat messages from the user
- `cf <query>` - Runs a chat filter against `query`
- `reloadusers` - Reloads the user manager (laggy)
